## Introduction
A YouTube channel called [Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/consumerchampion) made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrSl6T1My00) suggesting five projects beginners in Python can do. Since I have to stay at home right now because of the spread of COVID-19 disease in my country, I decided to spend my free time doing these projects and sharing them on my GitHub account.

`Disclaimer:` These projects are meant to be challenging but not impossible to someone who has been studying Python for some time, so I genuinely recommend you to try to solve them by yourself before looking at the solutions.
